# ðŸŽ¨ Color Wheel

The new color wheel, `ColorSelector`, is now available. You can use this brand new color selector to get information about your selected color visually. You can call the `OpenColorSelector()` function in your code to get the new color selector.

The color selector allows you to change the color in the following modes:

* In true color mode, you can change the hue, the lighting, and the saturation by pressing the appropriate key shortcuts to change the colors.
* In 256 and 16 colors mode, you can select a color using the right and the left arrow keys. It shows you color information, including the CMYK, HSL, and grayscale values.

The following controls are available:
